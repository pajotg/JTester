# JTester
Using testers for libft that dont test everything was annoying, so i made my own, and then i used it again for gnl and printf
The tester does has some bugs, not too manny hopefully, so check that what it is complaining about is actually a problem

The general way to test code is by running:
[path_to_JTester]/what_test/run_test.sh [path_to_code_to_test]

example:
~/Desktop/JTester/libft/run_test.sh . (when inside libft directory)
